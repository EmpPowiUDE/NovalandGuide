Summary
==========

Firstly, we will provide a brief overview of Novaland.
Subsequently, in the following chapter, we will delve into the various aspects of the game in detail.

Novaland is a political behavior game that immerses participants in a fictional state for several months. Participants are assigned different values, such as income, which influence their decision-making within the game.
They decide how to live in Novaland with their money and how much to save at the end of each month.
Various randomly assigned events, such as a forest fire or sudden unemployment, impact the gaming experience for everyone involved.
The highlight of the Novaland study is an event where participants can choose one of four parties that best reflects their values within Novaland, ultimately affecting their income.
Novaland is not played all at once; rather, individual phases are only accessible during specific time periods on the day of the study.
Finally, at the conclusion of the study, a survey is conducted to assess the reasons behind their decisions throughout the game.
