Running Novaland
======================

To test the 'Novaland' project, a local page can be created using a command that includes the project.
Follow these steps to run the Novaland project on your computer using PyCharm:

    1. Open your project in PyCharm
    2. Use the 'cd' command in the terminal to navigate to your project folder
    3. Type 'otree devserver' in the terminal.
    4. A link to a local page where you can access your project will appear, typically 'http://localhost:8000/'.

To be able to test the project with multiple participants, the project needs to be uploaded to :ref:`heroku-page`.
